The quotable office is an [R shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app that leverages the [schrute R package](https://bradlindblad.github.io/schrute/) to help you find quotes from [the office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/) given just a snippet of the line.

Use the live app at <https://bradleylindblad.shinyapps.io/quotableoffice>
